# Chapter 1: Basic about computer
This chapter cover about introduction computer history and kind of it.

## Introduce about the computer history
- Blaiser Pascal (1623 - 1662) was the creator of the first mechanical calculator.
- In 1970, the Pascal calculator was improved by Gottfried Leibritz (1646 - 1716) to perform the basic math.
- 19883, Charle Babbage made a breakthrough by deciding to develop computers with external program.
- John von Neumann introduced principles as decisive as the stored program in the machine, the interruption of the sequence in 1945.
## There are five generations of computers:
- First generation (1950 - 1958).
- The second generation (1959 - 1963).
- Third generation (1964 - 1977).
- Fourth generation (1978 - 1983).
- Fifth generation (1984 to present).
## There are five types of computers:
### Mainframe
- It's big size.
- It's alway used in government because of its fast calculartion speed.
### Super computer
- There are many parallel mainframe.
- Extremely fast computation.
- It's alway used in military and space.
### Personal computer.
- It's usually in an office or home.
### Laptop as know as "Note book"
- It's a small, lightweight computer that's easy to carry around.
- It runs on baterry.
### Pocket PC
- Personal technical equipment has a very rich function as check email, see movies, listen to music, browse the web. Multiple calculator functions mobile phone.
## The basic components of a computers.
- Software:system software and application software.
- Hardware: Memory, Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Input/ output device.
### The hardware devices - structure:
- Input.
- Central Processing Unit (Control unit, Register and Arithmectic Logic Unit).
- ROM, RAM, FDD, HDD, CD/ DVD.
- Output.
### The hardware devices - memory:
- The devices that stores information during computer processing.
### Hardware devices - internal memory:
#### ROM (Read Only Memory)
- Read only informations.
- Save system program.
- Not lost when power failure.
#### RAM (Random Access Memory)
- Random Access Memory.
- Loss of data during power failure.
