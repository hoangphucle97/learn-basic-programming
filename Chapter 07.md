## The basic concepts.
### Computer Programming.
- It is called programming for short.
- The art of putting one or more related abstract algorithms together in a programming language to create a computer program.

## The algorithmic properties.
### Includes the following 5 properties:
- The accuracy.
- The obvious.
- The objectivity.
- The popular.
- The end.
### Steps to build a program.
``` sh
Defining the problem -> Choose solution methods -> Build algorithm/solution -> Install program -> Program editing -> Program implementation.
```
